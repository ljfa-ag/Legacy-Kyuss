#Kyuss ManiaLink CMS

This is an old and long discontinued project of mine, a Content Management System for ManiaLinks in TrackMania United Forever.

This software is no longer under development (last change: April 2011) and I am providing it as Open Source just for posterity.
TrackMania United Forever has outlived its lifecycle by now, but maybe someone will find this PHP code useful.

It was capable of managing downloads for tracks and skins and basic blog functionalities, as well as a few more features that
I can't remember exactly.

Note: The documentation and some parts of Kyuss were written in German (unfortunately) and I can't be bothered to translate it,
however Kyuss itself should support German and English localization.

##Credits
The art (blau_h) was designed by lordaniel.

The name Kyuss was taken from a (former) Stoner Rock band of the same name.
